# UK-Online-Retail-Company-Analysis
Customer behavior and CLV analysis of UK Online Retail Dataset using Python and Power BI. Includes RFM segmentation, feature engineering, and XGBoost-enhanced CLV modeling.

# UK Online Retail Analysis

This project analyzes the **UK Online Retail Dataset** to study customer behavior, perform advanced sales analytics, and build **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) models**. Both Power BI and Python were used for different parts of the analysis.

## Project Overview

### Project Structure

### Python Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep dive into distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created additional features using libraries like `holidays` for time-based insights.
- **CLV Modeling:** 
  - Statistical models: BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models.
  - Enhanced modeling with **XGBoost** for better prediction accuracy.
- **RFM Analysis in Python:** Tested assumptions, visualized distributions, and generated actionable customer segments.
- **Visualization:** Clear charts for sales, customer segments, CLV predictions, and feature importance.
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations for business strategies based on data.

### Power BI Analysis
- **Sales Analysis:** Total and category-wise sales trends.
- **Returns Analysis:** Understanding return patterns and reasons.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Regional sales performance and export insights.
- **Time Analysis:** Monthly, weekly, and daily sales patterns.
- **RFM Analysis:** Segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
- **Export Analysis:** Export vs domestic sales comparison.
